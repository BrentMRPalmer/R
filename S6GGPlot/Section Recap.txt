Section Recap

1) Grammar of Graphics and GGPlot2

	Combined 7 layers onto one small 2D chart
	Data, Aesthetics, Geometries, Statistics, Aesthetics, Coordinates, Theme
2) Factors in R
	How R stores categorical variables
	Use factor() to convert
3) Aesthetics & ggplot()
	Colour, size, etc.
4) Plotting with layers
	Using the addition operator to add new layers

	Only need one axis for a histogram
8) Starting Layer Tips
	Which layer should you specify certain details?
9) Statistical Transformation
	geom_smooth(), geom_jitter(), etc.
10) Using Facets
	Allows you to create many plots on the same page
	Splits the data up by some quality
11) Coordinates
	How you can zoom into a chart
12) Themes
	Non-data-ink
	Ways to make visualizations look more appealing to the eye
