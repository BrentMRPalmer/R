Data - used in the background
Aesthetics - using colour fill and labelling axis (how is the data mapped?)
Geometries - boxes used to show the data
Statistics - creating new variables from existing data (grouping by genre)
Facets - multiple years
Coordinates - x-axis and y-axis, and the scale
Theme - everything else you see on the chart (title, colour of x and y axis, fonts, legend, etc.) (Non-data-ink)
