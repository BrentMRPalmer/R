Box Plot

Take the median - draw a line
Take the median of the top half and the bottom half - draw two lines
Draw two vertical lines to create a box
Add two horizontal lines on the minimum and maximum values (whiskers)

This leaves four ranges
Min-Q1
Q1-Median
Median-Q3
Q3-Max

Q3 - Q1 = Interquartile Range
1.5x IQR is considered an outlier (should not be included)
