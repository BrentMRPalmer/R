Section Recap

1) What is a vector?
	Basically a sequence of elements
	All of the elements have to be of the same type

2) Created some vectors: c(), seq(), rep()
	c() stands for combine
	seq() stands for sequence
	rep() stands for replicate

3) Check types: is.numeric(), ...
	Allows us to check the type of a vector

4) Using the [] brackets
	Used to access individual elements of vectors
	Variables of one element are also vectors

5) Vertorized operations
	Two vectors can have operations done on all matching elements
	Does not require a loop

6) Power of vectorized operations
	Vectorized shorter code
	Vectorized faster runtime (outsources operations to C)

7) Functions in R
	Similar to a blender (takes inputs, returns outputs)
	? operator lets you learn about functions

8) Packages in R
	Allows you to use premade functions
