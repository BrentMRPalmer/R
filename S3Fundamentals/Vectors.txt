What is a Vector?

A vector is a sequence (ordered set) of elements of the same data type.
The same thing as an array in other languages.

A numeric vector in R:
50 34 111 7 24 631 20 4 7 21

They are enumerated, starting with the index of 1.

A character vector in R:

"Z" "f" "7" "2a" "Yes" "A" "Ab"

Even a single number is stored as a vector of length 1.
