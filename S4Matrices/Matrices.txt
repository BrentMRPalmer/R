Matrices

Why are they so important?
Table format is a very efficient way to convey data
Tables are stored as matrices in R

A vector is essentially a 1xn matrix
A matrix can be nxm


	1	2	3	4	5

1	27	27	27	27	27

2	27	27	27	27	27

3	27	27	27	0	27

Indexation:
To access the 0, you write A[3,4]

To access an entire row, write A[x,]
To access an entire column, write A[,y]

A matrix can only have elements of the same type
